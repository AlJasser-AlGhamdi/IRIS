"""Deterministic scan-to-compliance mapping rules (Stage 4, the reproducible core).

A declarative rule table maps each Tier-1 check (and any catalog-tagged finding) to
one or more control IDs, with a rationale, remediation-template reference, and
reviewer note. Control IDs are **sourced from the Stage-3 check catalog** (single
source of truth) and **validated against the OSCAL catalog when the mapping engine is
constructed** (``validate_rules`` in ``MappingEngine.__init__``, before any mapping runs)
— if any rule or finding references an ID the catalog does not contain, construction
raises rather than emitting a fabricated control tag (spec §2.3 no-hallucination,
deterministic path).

This is intentionally not an LLM: the same finding always yields the same mapping
(spec §2 reproducibility). The ambiguous tail is handled separately by
:mod:`p2c.mapping.triage`, whose output is flagged ``needs_confirmation``.
